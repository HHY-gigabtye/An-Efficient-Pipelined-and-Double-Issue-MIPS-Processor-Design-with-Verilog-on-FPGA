# Verification

This document details the verification that ensures the functional correctness of the **Double-Issue MIPS Processor**, specifically focusing on hazard detection and parallel execution.

## 1. Verification Strategy
* **Simulation**: Observe whether the circuit run as expected and ideal cases.
* **FPGA Implementation**: The bitstream of the source code files are generated by Vivado 2022.2 and implemented on the NEXYS DDR4 FPGA Board.

## 2. Test Scenarios
To verify the Double-Issue logic, I used insertion sort to validate functionality.

## 3. Simulation Environment
* **Simulator**: ModelSim - Intel FPGA Starter Edition
* **FPGA Software**: Vivado 2022.2

## 4. Key Simulation Results
### Double-Issue Demonstration
Below is the waveform showing the **Dispatch Unit** issuing two instructions simultaneously:

*Observation: The Program Counter (PC) increments by 8, and two write-back signals occur at the same clock edge.*

## 6. Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)


## 5. How to Reproduce
Simulation:
1. Navigate to the `test/` directory.
2. Run the command: `[你的執行指令，例如: iverilog -o sim cpu_tb.v]`
3. Check the console output for `TEST PASSED` message.
