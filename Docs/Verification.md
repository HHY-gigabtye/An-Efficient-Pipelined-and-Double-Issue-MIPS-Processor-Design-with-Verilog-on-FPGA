# Verification

This document details the verification that ensures the functional correctness of the **Double-Issue MIPS Processor**, specifically focusing on hazard detection and parallel execution.

## 1. Verification Strategy
* **Simulation**: Observe whether the circuit run as expected and ideal cases.
* **FPGA Implementation**: The bitstream of the source code files are generated by Vivado 2022.2 and implemented on the NEXYS DDR4 FPGA Board.

## 2. Test Scenarios
To verify the Double-Issue logic, I used insertion sort to validate functionality.

## 3. Simulation Environment
* **Simulator**: ModelSim - Intel FPGA Starter Edition
* **FPGA Software**: Vivado 2022.2

## 4. Key Simulation Results
### Double-Issue Demonstration
Below is the waveform showing the process of **insertion sort**:

'in' signal represent input, and 'out' stands for output signal. They are **combined from data 1 to data 8 from left to right**. Once the sorting ends, output signal will imidiately fetch the data from data 1 to data 8.

## 5. Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)

![After Sorting](https://github.com/HHY-gigabtye/An-Efficient-Pipelined-and-Double-Issue-MIPS-Processor-Design-with-Verilog-on-FPGA/blob/main/Docs/After%20Sorting.jpg)

The FPGA verification result of insertion sort is shown above, the upward one is before sorting and the downward one is after sorting.

## 6. How to Reproduce
Simulation:
1. Add source codes form **SRC/** and **Testbench/** to the EDA tool(e.g., Vivado, ModelSim, or Icarus Verilog).
2. Simulate the mips_tb.v.

FPGA (NEXYS DDR4 FPGA Board):
1. Add source codes from **SRC/** and **FPGA/** to the  Vivado project.
2. Generate bitstream.
3. Connect to the FPGA board and use PS2 keyboard to input numbers (Press the central button to activate sorting).
